# My LIBFT
## A collection of simple functions for all sorts of little tasks (lib forty two)

This is 42 PARIS' first project, it consists in creating functions that replicate the behaviour of well known C functions (strchr, printf), as well as creating our own for specific tasks (substr, split)
I've also, through various projects, added small functions to help with tasks I've found useful, and I will continue to add to this library with time.
